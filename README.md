# IR&WA on US elections
## _Information Retrieval and Web Analysis applied to US elections 2020_
  The 2020 U.S. presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020. The Democratic ticket of former Vice President Joe Biden and California junior U.S. Senator Kamala Harris defeated Republican incumbent President Donald Trump and incumbent Vice President Mike Pence. The election saw the highest voter turnout by percentage since 1900, with each of the two major candidates receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes in 2008. 
This have possibly been the most followed elections of the last decades. Words such as "Biden", "Trump", or simply "US elections" were trending topic numerous times in social networks, including Twitter, the favorite tool of the then president Donald Trump.

  In the following project, a compilation of the tweets circulating at that time has been compiled and analyzed using an information retrieval model and further analysis of the collected web data.
